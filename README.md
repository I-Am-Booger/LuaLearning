# LuaLearning ðŸš€

Welcome to **LuaLearning**â€”a personal journey into Lua, documented day by day.

## ðŸ“œ About
This repo is a structured learning experience, where I explore Lua from scratch. Each day covers a few key concepts, followed by hands-on projects to reinforce the lessons.

## ðŸ“† Learning Progress
- **Day 1**: Print statements, variables, basic input
- **Day 2**: Conditionals, functions, user interaction
- **Day 3**: _(Coming Soon: Loops, animation, and dynamic sequences)_

## ðŸ”¨ How to Run
To run any Lua script in this repo:
1. Install Lua (if not already installed) [ðŸ”— Lua official site](https://www.lua.org/)
2. Navigate to the script directory
3. Execute with:
   ```bash
   lua script_name.lua
